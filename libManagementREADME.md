The project has been made, using JDBC technology, for storing school/college
library-related information in a database to reduce the manual workload of the staff
and to make library management more easy and accessible to all. The project has a
menu at the start from which the operations to conduct can be chosen by the user
(librarian or administrator or student). Any student can register in the library free
of cost and take advantage of the benefits of an online library which can be used
anywhere and anytime and free of cost.
