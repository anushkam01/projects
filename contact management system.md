In this mini-project, we will create a simple contact book using Python. The contact book will allow users to perform basic operations such as adding a new contact, viewing all contacts, searching for a contact, and deleting a contact. This project will help you practice fundamental concepts of Python programming, including file handling and basic data structures.
Features:
Add Contact: Users can add a new contact by providing details such as name, phone number, and address. The contact information will be stored in a file for future use.
View all Contacts: Users can view a list of all contacts in the contact book, displaying their names and phone numbers.
Search Contacts: Users can search for a specific contact by entering the name. If the contact exists, its details will be displayed.
Update Contact: Users can update the saved contacts by searching them by name.
Delete Contact: Users can delete a contact by entering the name. If the contact exists, it will be removed from the contact book.
